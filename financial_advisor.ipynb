As more glove is needed during the pandemic which cause the price and earning of Top Glove to Increase. As evidence, by company manager Lee Kim Meow stated that the goods are all sold out to their distributors and customers even before the supplies have arrived at Top-Glove warehouse. As the vaccination plan all over the world is being ramp up and being administer to more and more people which mean that the Covid-19 pandemic is being more and more in control. This would lead to decrease in the earning for Top-glove back to its average earnings before the pandemic. According to Top-Glove presentation in 2018 (refer to chart 1), Top Glove key market include Europe, North America and Asia make up Top Glove sales by 31%, 25% and 23% respectively. As USA have a sharp decrease in Covid-19 cases as of today using a 7 day average USA have around 12k of new Covid-19 cases while they are administering the vaccine at the doses per day of around 1 million. This means that the vaccine is being administer at a rate that the virus is infecting people slower than the vaccine is being administer.Furthermore in Europe, Germany is also show that the Covid-19 cases have been similar to the flatten peak from the highest at 15399 new cases at 25 of April 2021 to 903 at 8 of July 2021which means they overcome their second wave with the vaccine being administer in Germany at a rate about 600k to 800k per day . Meanwhile in China the curve have always been flatten since March 2020 with the past 7 days average have 20 daily cases while daily doses of vaccination being administer by China is around 15 million to 20 million a day.  \"\n",

As more glove is needed during the pandemic which cause the price and earning of Top Glove to Increase. As evidence, by company manager Lee Kim Meow stated that the goods are all sold out to their distributors and customers even before the supplies have arrived at Top-Glove warehouse. As the vaccination plan all over the world is being ramp up and being administer to more and more people which mean that the Covid-19 pandemic is being more and more in control. This would lead to decrease in the earning for Top-glove back to its average earnings before the pandemic. According to Top-Glove presentation in 2018 (refer to chart 1), Top Glove key market include Europe, North America and Asia make up Top Glove sales by 31%, 25% and 23% respectively. As USA have a sharp decrease in Covid-19 cases as of today using a 7 day average USA have around 12k of new Covid-19 cases while they are administering the vaccine at the doses per day of around 1 million. This means that the vaccine is being administer at a rate that the virus is infecting people slower than the vaccine is being administer.Furthermore in Europe, Germany is also show that the Covid-19 cases have been similar to the flatten peak from the highest at 15399 new cases at 25 of April 2021 to 903 at 8 of July 2021which means they overcome their second wave with the vaccine being administer in Germany at a rate about 600k to 800k per day . Meanwhile in China the curve have always been flatten since March 2020 with the past 7 days average have 20 daily cases while daily doses of vaccination being administer by China is around 15 million to 20 million a day.  \"\n",
